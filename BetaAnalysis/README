filename_path points to a directory where two folders ("raw" and "stats") must be created before starting the analysis
input_filename should be "DUT_directory/file_name"  --> DUT_directory must be placed within the "raw" directory previosly created
The analysis script will take care of creating the other directories
voltage and time scalar are conversion factors to get amplitude and time in mV and ns, respectively. Change them according to your setup
active_channels = number of channels active on the oscilloscope
n_points_baseline: number of points used to calculate the baseline offset (the first n points of the acquisition window)
search_range: if set to one, the Pmax of events will be caclulated only in the time window defined by pmax_search_range_min / pmax_search_range_max
ps_channelx : if set to 1 means that the power supply recorded the current of channel x
