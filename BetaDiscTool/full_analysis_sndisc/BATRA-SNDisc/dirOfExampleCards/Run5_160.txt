# To use a channel, specify whether it is a DUT or MCP or REF.
# For DUT, a fit will be performed.
# For MCP, time resolution will be extracted from the DUT temporally to this.
# For REF, the channel will be shown in plotting but not fitted or used for time resolution
# Specify channel with the board type, e.g. "DUT, SC" so during analysis the area can be accurately converted to charge
# Also specify the thickness of the sensor, in microns

# Specify which selections should be applied to which channel (these are not applied simultaneously unless calculating time resolution
# For time resolution, the MCP channel selection is applied with the corresponding DUT.
# If the three-DUT setup is used, the cuts for the relevant channels for time resolution extraction will be applied
# The inputs are PMAX_LOWER,PMAX_UPPER,NEGPMAX_LOWER,TMAX_LOWER,TMAX_UPPER (in mV and ns), written e.g. [20,34,40],160,-20,-0.5,0.5.
# PMAX_LOWER has to be an array of comma-separated values of length equal to the number of files.
# If the value is 0 (or [] or 0 for PMAX_LOWER), no cut will be performed.
